# Exploratory data analysis of water temperature from Copernicus Marine Data 

In this EDA, I hope to achieve the following 4 goals:

1. Extract water temperature data from Copernicus Marine Data Store

2. Preprocess the extracted temperature data

3. Compare buoy reported temperatures and Copernicusâ€™ reported temperatures

4. Visualize the differences
